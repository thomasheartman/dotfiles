** Package archives

   I'll sometimes want to use local packages. I'll put them in a

                  (expand-file-name

   Similarly to how spacemacs has the leader key and a number of
   mnemonic bindings, it'd be nice to do something similar.

   I'd define a standard prefix, possibly a function key, and then spin
   off from there. I'd like separate ones for
   - things :: various apps and utilities. Elfeed, notmuch, org-agenda,
               notes, etc
   - lsp / prog :: a key that gets you access to all bindings specified
                   for the major prog mode you're working in.
   - errors :: flycheck and or flyspell. Probably a hydra that lets you
               go from error to error (or just suggestions), correct
               them, or view all in a separate window


   Let's create a couple prefixes:
   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (defconst my-format-buffer "<f1>")

     (defmacro create-definer (name key)
       "Create a constant and an associated definer.

     Use NAME to generate the name of the constant and definer, and
     use KEY for the definer prefix."
       (let ((constant-name (intern (format "my-%s-prefix" name)))
             (def-name (intern (format "my-%s-def" name))))
         `(progn
            (defconst ,constant-name ,key)
            (general-create-definer ,def-name :prefix ,constant-name))))

     (defmacro create-definers (&rest bindings)
       "Create definers for the given list of arguments.

     BINDINGS is a list of name and keys."
       (let (forms)
         (while bindings
           (let ((key (pop bindings)))
             (when (not bindings)
               (error "Couldn't create definers. The provided bindings are unbalanced"))
             (let ((value (pop bindings)))
               (push `(create-definer ,key ,value) forms))))
         `(progn ,@(nreverse forms))))

     (create-definers
      "link" "C-x l"

* Emacs

** Visual

  These changes relate to how Emacs itself looks, including frames,
  windows, and the like.

*** Frames

    Get rid of tool bars and menu bars:
    #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
      (menu-bar-mode -1)
      (tool-bar-mode -1)
    #+END_SRC

*** Windows

    Let's get rid of scroll bars:
    #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
      (set-scroll-bar-mode nil)
    #+END_SRC

*** Theme

    To load a theme in Emacs, the default way is to use `M-x
    load-theme`. This works well except for the fact that you need to
    confirm that you really want to load it unless it's been added to
    the 'safe themes' custom list. Also, Emacs doesn't disable the
    modifications from a previous theme when you load a new one, so if
    the previous theme defines more faces than the new one, some of
    these will remain. To get around that we'll disable the old theme
    if it is not the same as the new one.

    #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
      (defun heartman/load-theme (theme)
        "Load custom theme named THEME from its file and enable it.

      Calls out to Emacs' own `load-theme' under the hood."
        (interactive
         (list
          (intern
           (completing-read "Load custom theme: "
                            (mapcar #'symbol-name
                                    (custom-available-themes))))))

        (let ((old-theme (car custom-enabled-themes)))
          (when (not (eq theme old-theme))
            (message "Disabling theme %s" old-theme theme)
            (disable-theme old-theme))
          (load-theme theme t)
          (message "Loaded theme %s" theme)))
    #+END_SRC


**** one-themes
     :PROPERTIES:
     :REPO:     [[https://github.com/balajisivaraman/emacs-one-themes][GitHub]]
     :header-args: :tangle no
     :END:

     I've been stuck with the Atom One Dark theme since I first saw it
     a couple of years ago. This theme is the best Emacs-version I've
     seen of it thus far.

     However, the theme also affects certain font faces by default,
     enabling mixed-pitch-mode for certain headings and changing other
     font sizes. While it's not terrible, Emacs does better without
     changing these things, so let's disable those changes.

     #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
       (use-package one-themes
         :after org
         :init
         (setq emacs-one-use-variable-pitch nil
               emacs-one-scale-org-headlines nil
               emacs-one-height-minus-1 1.0
               emacs-one-height-plus-1 1.0
               emacs-one-height-plus-2 1.0
               emacs-one-height-plus-3 1.0
               emacs-one-height-plus-4 1.0)
         :config
         (load-theme 'one-dark t))

     #+END_SRC

**** doom themes
     :PROPERTIES:
     :REPO:     [[https://github.com/hlissner/emacs-doom-themes][GitHub]]
     :END:

     #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
       (use-package doom-themes
         :config
         (setq doom-themes-enable-bold t
               doom-themes-enable-italic t)
         (load-theme 'doom-palenight t)
         (doom-themes-visual-bell-config)
         (doom-themes-org-config))
     #+END_SRC



*** Font

    The default font size is a bit small on my monitors, so we'll
    increase it sufficiently.
    #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
      (set-face-attribute 'default nil :height 200)
    #+END_SRC

    Next, let's set a list of my preferred fonts (in descending order
    of preference), and check whether they exist on the system. If
    they do, we'll set the first font we find as the default frame
    font.

    #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
      (setq preferred-fonts '("JetBrains Mono"
                              "Cascadia Code"
                              "Victor Mono"))

      (require 'cl)

      (let ((font (find-if
                   (lambda (font) (member font (font-family-list))) preferred-fonts)))
        (when font
          (set-frame-font font t t)))
    #+END_SRC


** Misc

*** ido mode

    Inspired by the [[https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/introduction-to-ido-mode][Introduction to ido mode article]] from Mastering
    Emacs, let's enable ido mode everywhere and also enable
    flex-matching.
    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (setq ido-enable-flex-matching t)
    #+end_src

    We can also use ido-mode for find file at point.
    #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
      (setq ido-use-filename-at-point 'guess)
    #+END_SRC

    When entering a buffer name that doesn't exist when changing
    buffers, let's let ido-mode create a new buffer.
    #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (setq ido-create-new-buffer 'always)
    #+END_SRC

*** Prompts

    Taking another cue from Mastering Emacs ([[https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/disabling-prompts-emacs][Disabling Prompts in
    Emacs]]), let's reduce the amount of prompts we come across in
    Emacs:
    #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
      (fset 'yes-or-no-p 'y-or-n-p)
      (setq confirm-nonexistent-file-or-buffer nil)
    #+END_SRC

    We can also disable prompts about killing buffers with live
    processes attached.
    #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
      (setq kill-buffer-query-funcions
	    (remq 'process-kill-buffer-query-function
		  kill-buffer-query-functions))
    #+END_SRC

*** subword mode

    Subword mode lets you navigate and act on parts of words when they
    consist of multiple words put together, separated by capital
    letters (as is common in programming), such as "GtkWindow" ("Gtk"
    and "Window").

    #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
      (dolist (mode '(prog-mode-hook text-mode-hook))
        (add-hook mode (lambda () (subword-mode 1))))
    #+END_SRC

*** Hungry-backspace

    Let's set up global hungry backspace keybindings too.

    #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
      (general-def
        "C-c <DEL>" 'c-hungry-delete-backwards
        "C-c C-<DEL>" 'c-hungry-delete-backwards
        "C-c <C-delete>" 'c-hungry-delete-forward
        "C-c <deletechar>" 'c-hungry-delete-forward)
    #+END_SRC


*** Startup

    Let's get rid of splash screens and startup messages that we don't
    need (also from [[https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/disabling-prompts-emacs][Disabling Prompts in Emacs]]):
    #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
      (setq inhibit-startup-message t
	    inhibit-startup-echo-area-message t)
    #+END_SRC


*** recent files (recentf)                                       :keybinding:

    Mickey Petersen suggests using the recent files package in his
    [[https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/find-files-faster-recent-files-package][Find Files Faster with the Recent Files Package]], so we'll copy his
    suggested configuration here.

    #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
      (require 'recentf)

      (global-set-key (kbd "C-x C-r") 'ido-recentf-open)

      (recentf-mode t)

      (setq recentf-max-saved-items 50)

      (defun ido-recentf-open ()
	"Use `ido-completing-read to \\[find-file] a recent file"
	(interactive)
	(if (find-file (ido-completing-read "Find recent file: " recentf-list))
	    (message "Opening file ...")
	  (message "Aborting")))
    #+END_SRC

*** Quality of life things

    Additionally, let's enable a few things that just makes life
    better in general:

    Electric pair mode is great for automatic insertion of matching
    braces. However, it clashes with smartparens, so we'll leave it
    out for now.
    #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
      ;; (electric-pair-mode)
    #+END_SRC

    Further, let's enable line numbers everywhere.
    #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
      (global-display-line-numbers-mode)
    #+END_SRC

    Make lines wrap visually if they're longer than what can fit in
    the window. By default, visual line mode overrides a number of
    functions that work on lines, but I find this confusing, so we'll
    remove the key overrides it provides.
    #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
      (global-visual-line-mode)
      (general-unbind
        'visual-line-mode-map
        [remap kill-line]
        [remap move-beginning-of-line]
        [remap move-end-of-line])
    #+END_SRC

    I prefer ending sentences with single spaces (even if I see the
    benefits of using two, as recommended by Emacs), so let's also
    tell Emacs that it's okay.
    #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
      (setq sentence-end-double-space nil)
    #+END_SRC

    I also want files to auto-update if they change on disk.
    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (global-auto-revert-mode)
    #+end_src

    Trailing whitespace is something I prefer to avoid, so let's
    delete that on save.
    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (add-hook 'before-save-hook 'delete-trailing-whitespace)
    #+end_src

    For text modes, let's always use auto-fill mode and orgtbl-mode:
    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (defun my-text-mode-hook ()
	(auto-fill-mode)
	(abbrev-mode))
      (add-hook 'text-mode-hook 'my-text-mode-hook)
    #+end_src

**** Removing suspend-frame                                      :keybinding:

     To disable suspend-frame (I don't think I've ever meant to
     activate it), we'll instead replace it by a message saying it has
     been unmapped.
     #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
       (global-set-key [remap suspend-frame]
	 (lambda ()
	   (interactive)
	   (message "This keybinding is disabled (was 'suspend-frame')")))
     #+END_SRC

**** Don't pause redisplay on input events

     According to [[https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/improving-performance-emacs-display-engine][Improving the performance of Emacs's Display Engine?]]
     by Mickey Petersen, Emacs defaults to pausing all display
     redrawing on any input. This may have been useful previously, but
     is not necessary anymore.
     #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
       (setq redisplay-dont-pause t)
     #+END_SRC

**** Silence 'function got redefined' warnings

     It seems some packages redefine certain functions defined
     elsewhere. This creates noise in the startup messages. Because I
     don't mind this at the moment, I'll silence it:
     #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
       (setq ad-redefinition-action 'accept)
     #+END_SRC

**** Activate winner-mode

     #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
       (winner-mode)
     #+END_SRC

**** Backups

     Emacs makes backups by default. I don't want this.

     I'll also turn off auto-save and similar files.

     These settings are based on the ErgoEmacs articles [[http://ergoemacs.org/emacs/emacs_auto_save.html][Emacs: Auto
     Save]] and [[http://ergoemacs.org/emacs/emacs_set_backup_into_a_directory.html][Emacs: Turn Off Backup]].
     #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
       (setq make-backup-files nil
             auto-save-default nil
             create-lockfiles nil)
     #+END_SRC

**** TODO Auto-clearing the echo area
     :LOGBOOK:
     - State "TODO"       from "TODO"       [2020-08-21 Fri 09:41] \\
       Consider whether I actually want this or not.
     - State "TODO"       from              [2020-08-17 Mon 19:50]
     :END:

     Text displayed in the echo area is often helpful, but it stays
     around until you do something again. If the output is large
     (several lines), then it can often be more of a nuisance.

     The variable ~minibuffer-message-clear-timeout~ was introduced in
     Emacs 27 ([[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/ibi8rj/clear_the_echo_area_after_timeout/g1vtvyq?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x][according to this Reddit comment thread]]) and might work
     for this, so we'll use that if we can.

     #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
       (if (version< emacs-version "27")
           (run-with-idle-timer 5 t (lambda () (message nil)))
         (setq minibuffer-message-clear-timeout 5))
     #+END_SRC

**** Change frame font size

     I've got a multi-monitor setup that has a number of different
     resolutions and screen sizes. A comfortable font size on one
     screen can be too small or too large on another one. As such, I
     want a quick and simple way to adjust these on the fly.

     #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
       (defun my-change-frame-font-size ()
         (interactive)
         (set-face-attribute 'default (selected-frame)
                             :height (string-to-number
                                      (read-string "Font height:"))))

       (general-def
         "C-x C-z" 'my-change-frame-font-size)
     #+END_SRC

**** Repeat jump to mark

     When you want to jump to the previous position in the mark ring,
     you can use ~C-u SPC~ . If you want to jump multiple positions,
     you must repeat the ~C-u~ press. However, we can make this
     unnecessary:

     #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
       (setq set-mark-command-repeat-pop t)

       (defun my-unpop-mark ()
         "Unpop off mark ring. Does nothing if mark ring is empty."
         (interactive)
         (when mark-ring
           (setq mark-ring (cons (copy-marker (mark-marker)) mark-ring))
           (set-marker (mark-marker) (car (last mark-ring)) (current-buffer))
           (when (null (mark t)) (ding))
           (setq mark-ring (nbutlast mark-ring))
           (goto-char (marker-position (car (last mark-ring))))))


       (general-def
         :predicate '(or
                      (eq last-command 'my-unpop-mark)
                      (eq last-command 'pop-to-mark-command))
         "C-M-SPC" 'my-unpop-mark)
     #+END_SRC


**** delete-selection-mode

     More often than not, when I start typing while I've got an active
     region, I want to overwrite what's in the region. The same goes
     for when I'm pasting content. By default, Emacs doesn't do this,
     but it can easily be enabled:

     #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
       (delete-selection-mode)
     #+END_SRC

     In case you're using smartparens or other packages that
     auto-surround a selection if you input certain delimiters: don't
     worry. They'll still work as intended.

**** Switch to previously used window

     Emacs doesn't come with an obvious way to cycle between most
     recently used windows, but we can create a simple version that
     switches to the most previously used window, at least. This is
     based on code by github user luciferasm and [[https://github.com/abo-abo/ace-window/issues/125#issuecomment-377354995][was posted in an
     issue on ace-window]].

     #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
       (defun my-previous-window ()
         "Switch to the previously active window."
         (interactive)
         (let ((win (get-mru-window t t t)))
           (unless win (error "There is no last window to switch to"))
           (let ((frame (window-frame win)))
             (raise-frame frame)
             (select-frame frame)
             (select-window win))))
     #+END_SRC

**** Smarter ~C-a~

     When using ~C-a~, I usually want to move to the first
     non-whitespace character on the line, even if that is indented.
     However, sometimes I want to distinguish between the first
     non-whitespace character and column 0. As such, let's write a
     function that takes you to indentation first, and to column 0 if
     you press it again.

     Adapted from [[https://emacsredux.com/blog/2013/05/22/smarter-navigation-to-the-beginning-of-a-line/][this Emacs Redux blog post]], the option to provide an
     argument is mostly for compatibility with the original function
     it's made to override.

     #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
       (defun my-move-beginning-of-line (arg)
         "Move point back to indentation or beginning of line.

       Move point to the first non-whitespace character on this line. If
       point is already at this character, move to the beginning of the
       line. Lets you toggle between first non-whitespace character and

       If ARG is not nil or 1, move forward ARG - 1 lines first. If

         (interactive "^p")

         (when (/= arg 1)
           (let ((line-move-visual nil))
             (forward-line (1- arg))))

         (let ((origin (point)))
           (back-to-indentation)
           (when (= origin (point))

**** Enable all commands

     By default, Emacs disables a number of commands to stop new users
     from accidentally triggering them and doing something they don't
     expect. To enable all these commands, we do the following:

     #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
       (setq disabled-command-function nil)
     #+END_SRC

**** Open line

     By default, the ~open-line~ function doesn't indent the part of
     the line that gets put onto the next line. I've always found this
     to be unintuitive, so let's fix it with this little function.

     #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
       (defun my-open-line ()
         (interactive)
         (save-excursion
           (newline)
           (indent-for-tab-command)))

       (general-def
         [remap open-line] 'my-open-line)
     #+END_SRC

**** Revert buffer

     Let's create a function that'll revert a buffer from file:

     #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
       (defun my-revert-buffer ()
         "Revert the current buffer with no confirmation."
         (interactive)
         (revert-buffer :ignore-auto :noconfirm))

       (general-def
         "C-c b r" 'my-revert-buffer)
     #+END_SRC

**** RE-builder

     As [[https://masteringemacs.org/article/re-builder-interactive-regexp-builder][recommended by Mickey]], let's set the default RE-builder
     syntax to be ~string~. Remember that it'll be converted to elisp
     if you copy it with ~C-c C-w~.

     #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
       (require 're-builder)
       (setq reb-re-syntax 'string)
     #+END_SRC

**** Undo-redo

     With Emacs 28.1 comes redo-functionality. Let's bind that to
     something useful if it's available.

     #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
       (when (functionp 'undo-redo)
         (general-def
           "M-/" 'undo-redo))
     #+END_SRC

**** Unfill region

       Update this to use a prefix argument for acting on the entire buffer?
     :END:

     I like using auto-fill mode when in Emacs. However, if I want to
     copy the content of a buffer into a different application, I'll
     often want to get rid of the added newlines. As such, here's a
     function to unfill the current region or the current paragraph if
     there is no region. With a prefix arg, unfill the whole buffer.

     #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
       (defun unfill-paragraph (&optional region operate-on-whole-buffer)
         "Unfill the current paragraph or the region if it is active.

       With a prefix argument, unfill the whole buffer."
         (interactive (progn (barf-if-buffer-read-only) (list t current-prefix-arg)))
         (let ((fill-column (point-max))
               (emacs-lisp-docstring-fill-column t))
           (if operate-on-whole-buffer
               (fill-region (buffer-end -1) (buffer-end 1))
             (fill-paragraph nil region))))

       (general-def
         "M-Q" 'unfill-paragraph)
     #+END_SRC

**** Dired config

     We can configure dired to behave a little more intuitively than
     it does by default.

     #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
       (setq dired-isearch-filenames t)
     #+END_SRC

**** Display battery in mode line

     #+END_SRC


*** Switch to window

    When switching windows, it's sometimes easier to switch by name
    than by navigating one window/frame at a time. This function
    displays the list of the buffers displayed in the current windows
    and allows you to switch to a window based on the buffer it
    contains.

    #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
      (defun heartman/select-window (name)
        "Switch to a window containing a buffer by the name of NAME.

      If multiple windows contain buffers with the same name, which one
      is chosen is not guaranteed."
        (interactive
         (list
          (intern
           (completing-read "Switch to window: "
                            (mapcar (lambda (w) (buffer-name (window-buffer w)))
                                    (window-list-1 nil nil 'visible))))))
        (select-window (car (seq-filter
                             (lambda (window)
                               (string= name (buffer-name (window-buffer window))))

      case, and it would also give me a chance to try and understand how
      advice works.
    :END:

    By default, emacs scrolls a whole screen at a time. I'd rather it
    scrolled half a screen as that makes it easier to keep your

*** Garbage collection

    Inspired by the [[https://github.com/lewang/flx][flx's readme]], we can increase the GC threshold

*** subprocess throughput

    This section increases the throughput available to subprocesses.
    This value was hardcoded before Emacs 27, so we first want to
    check whether the variable is bound or not. If it is, increase it.

    #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

***** Resizing

      Using Amethyst as a window manager on macOS, the Emacs frame will
      often not expand to take up the whole allotted space, leaving a
      gap between itself and the edge of the screen or other
      applications. To fix this, make frames resize pixelwise:
      #+name: resize
      #+begin_src emacs-lisp
        (setq frame-resize-pixelwise t)
      #+end_src

***** $PATH and ~exec-path~

      Dealing with path variables can be tricky. Because I use
      #+name: macos-exec-path
      #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
        (setq exec-path (append exec-path '("/Library/Frameworks/Mono.framework/Commands"
                                            "/usr/local/bin"
                                            "/usr/local/share/dotnet"
                                            "~/.dotnet/tools"

      #+END_SRC

      Additionally, to avoid having to set this manually for programs
      that use the "PATH" variable (and because it seems to not get
      set correctly), we'll manually add a couple directories to
      ~$PATH~:

      #+name: macos-env-path
      #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

      #+END_SRC

***** Key switching

      On macOS, I want the CMD key to act as Meta, and the Alt key as
      super, because this works better with their location on the

    :END:

    One of the things I really like about Spacemacs is that the key
    for maximizing a window if there are other windows in the frame is
    also the key for bringing the other windows back if the current
    window is the only one.

    Turns out that function is based on [[https://gist.github.com/mads-hartmann/3402786][this gist]], which we can
    casually copy here.
    #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
      (defun my-maximize-or-undo-window ()
        "If there are multiple windows in the frame, maximize the
        current one. If there is only one window in the current frame,
        revert to the previous multi-window configuration."
        (interactive)
        (save-excursion
          (if (and (= 1 (count-windows))
                   (assoc ?_ register-alist))
              (jump-to-register ?_)
            (progn
              (window-configuration-to-register ?_)
              (delete-other-windows)))))
    #+END_SRC

    Further, I'd love to be able to maximize windows vertically or
    horizontally. Again, this is functionality Spacemacs has, so let's
    go from there.

    And if we can maximize horizontally and vertically, why not make
    it more fine-grained? What if you only want to expand in one
    direction?

    And finally: what if you just want to 'eat' the next window in a
    given direction? Yeah, we can do all of them.

    First, let's define functionality to delete windows in a direction
    until there's nothing left to delete.
    #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
      (defun delete-until-end (move)
        (while (condition-case nil (funcall move) (error nil))
          (delete-window)))
    #+END_SRC

    Now, let's implement this for the four directions. NOTE: I'm sure
    this can be done in a fancier, metaprogramming-like way. Please,
    /do/ @ me!
    #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
      (defun delete-windows-to-the-left ()
        "Delete all windows to the left of the current one"
        (interactive)
        (delete-until-end 'windmove-left))

      (defun delete-windows-to-the-right ()
        "Delete all windows to the right of the current one"
        (interactive)
        (delete-until-end 'windmove-right))

      (defun delete-windows-above ()
        "Delete all windows above the current one"
        (interactive)
        (delete-until-end 'windmove-up))

      (defun delete-windows-below ()
        "Delete all windows below the current one"
        (interactive)
        (delete-until-end 'windmove-down))
    #+END_SRC

    Now horizontal and vertical are just extensions of what we've got
    above:
    #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
      (defun maximize-window-horizontally ()
        (interactive)
        (save-excursion
          (delete-windows-to-the-left)
          (delete-windows-to-the-right)))

      (defun maximize-window-vertically ()
        (interactive)
        (save-excursion
          (delete-windows-above)
          (delete-windows-below)))
    #+END_SRC

    Swell! That only leaves eating the next window in one direction.
    Again, let's define the base function and then one-line
    implementations! Or ... before we got too ahead of ourselves,
    let's think about how Emacs works with windows.

    If you delete a window, another window will take its place so that
    we don't get an empty hole in the frame. However, from what I've
    gathered, Emacs follows a few simple rules when deciding which
    window will grow to take the newly opened space.

    - If there is only one window left, grow this one.
    - If there are multiple candidates that could fill the void,
      always pick the candidate to the left or above. In other words:
      windows only grow downwards and to the right.

    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      +--------+
      |  |  |  |
      |  |  |x | <- if we delete the window to the left
      |  |  |  |
      +--------+



      +--------+
      |     |  |
      |     |x | <- this is what we'll get
      |     |  |
      +--------+
    #+END_EXAMPLE

    This last point is quite important. It means that if you want to
    grow a window up or to the left: that's not as easy as you might
    have thought. Further: you can't just swap the buffers and delete
    to the right either, because that wouldn't always work.

    As an example, say you have this setup, where ~x~ is your current window.
    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      +----+----+
      |    |    |
      |    |----|
      |    | x  |
      +----+----+
    #+END_EXAMPLE

    If you want to simply expand one window to the left (into the tall
    window), you'd expect to end up with a horizontally split screen.
    But if we swap the two windows first and expand to the right,

    However, it is doable. Here's how (using left as the direction,
    but it works for up too).

    1. First move to the left window.
    2. Before deleting it, get the width (height) of the window using
       ~window-total-width~ (~window-total-height~).
    3. After the window has been deleted, try and move to the left
       again. If you can't, that means there was no third window to
       the left that could have taken your place. If you /can/,
       however: Move into that window and ~shrink-window-horizontally~
       (~shrink-window~) by the width (height) of the window that we
       deleted.
    4. Then, move back into the window we started from.

  Following the [[https://oremacs.com/swiper/][Ivy Documentation]], let's install Ivy (and Counsel and
  Swiper) using counsel. We'll also add Ivy's ~swiper-isearch~ and

  For searches, I also prefer using a fuzzier regex pattern than the
  default, so this is set up by assigning ~ivy--regex-fuzzy~.

  By default, ~ivy-initial-inputs-alist~ instructs most ivy-functions
  to put a ~^~ at the start of the search. While this can be useful
  sometimes, I prefer to insert one myself when I need it.

  TODO: We need to set this up properly. In addition to wanting to use
  tab-n-go, I also want to be able to use TAB to expand completions

  In addition to the basic company-mode configuration, I also use
  [[https://github.com/company-mode/company-mode/blob/master/company-tng.el][company-tng]] to get YCMD-like behavior. This requires a little extra

  When using varying font sizes within a buffer, this can make the
  company completion dropdown misaligned (with itself, even). Using
  the [[https://github.com/tumashu/company-posframe][company-posframe package]] appears to fix this by putting
  completions in a separate frame.

  To make completions a bit smoother, I use [[https://github.com/PythonNut/company-flx][company-flx]] to allow for
  fuzzy matching when company uses the company-capf backend. I'll also

  which-key shows you a pop-up when you're in the middle of typing key

  Because I generally don't want which-key to pop up and disturb the

* Vim-like isearch motions

  As outlined in [[https://blog.thomasheartman.com/posts/my-first-emacs-lisp][this blog post]], I don't really like how isearch jumps
  to the end of the search string when jumping forwards. At least not
  as a general rule. I prefer Vim's style of searching, where you're
  always placed at the beginning of the term. So I wrote some code to
  deal with that.

  In addition to defining of extra functions for copying and
  deleting the selected text, Vim-style, we'll also remap the default
  ~isearch-exit~ binding (~<return>~), to use the Vim-style binding
  instead. In the event that I want to use the default isearch exit
  functionality, let's bind that to something else.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (defun isearch-vim-style-exit ()
      "Move point to the start of the matched string, regardless
      of search direction."
      (interactive)
      (when (eq isearch-forward t)
        (goto-char isearch-other-end))
      (isearch-exit))

    (defun isearch-vim-style-kill ()
      "Kill up to the search match when searching forward. When
      searching backward, kill to the beginning of the match."
      (interactive)
      (isearch-vim-style-exit)
      (call-interactively 'kill-region))

    (defun isearch-vim-style-copy ()
      "Copy up to the search match when searching forward. When
      searching backward, copy to the start of the search match."

* Org mode

** Getting Things Done (GTD)                                            :GTD:

   Because I am working on implementing the GTD methodology, I want to configure org mode to work with this as easily as possible. This section is based heavily on [[https://emacs.cafe/emacs/orgmode/gtd/2017/06/30/orgmode-gtd.html][this blog post]] by Nicolas Petton over at [[https://emacs.cafe/emacs/orgmode/gtd/2017/06/30/orgmode-gtd.html][Emacs Café]].

*** Capture templates

    Configure capture templates to use for adding new entries to the inbox.
    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (setq org-capture-templates
	    '(("i" "Inbox (GTD)" entry (file "~/gtd/inbox.org")
	       "* %^{title}\n  :LOGBOOK:\n  - Created %U\n  :END:\n  %i%?"  :empty-lines 1)
	      ("p" "Project (GTD)" entry (file+headline "~/gtd/main.org" "Tasks")
	       "* %^{title} [/]\n  :LOGBOOK:\n  - Created %U\n  :END:\n  %i%?"  :empty-lines 1)))
    #+end_src

*** Refile targets

    Configure refile targets for when moving items from the inbox to their correct positions. The ~(nil :maxlevel . N)~ entry means that the current file will also be searched for refile targets, and the ~(org-buffer-list :maxlevel . N)~ entry means that any org buffer is also used for targets.
    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (setq org-refile-targets '((nil :maxlevel . 5)
                                 (org-buffer-list :maxlevel . 2)
                                 ("~/gtd/main.org" :maxlevel . 5)
                                 ("~/gtd/someday-maybe.org" :level . 1)
                                 ("~/gtd/tickler.org" :maxlevel . 2)))
    #+end_src

    #+end_src

    I also want to enable setting tags with a single press and without a pop-up menu:
    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (setq org-use-fast-tag-selection t)
      (setq org-fast-tag-selection-single-key t)
    #+end_src

*** todo keywords

    Here's the set of keywords I use for tracking states for my list items:
    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (setq org-todo-keywords
            '((sequence "TODO(t!)" "NEXT(n!)" "WAITING(w@)" "|" "DONE(d!)" "CANCELED(c!)")))
    #+end_src

*** key bindings                                                 :keybinding:

    Since let's also define some sensible bindings for org mode! In
    particular, let's make it easy to create capture templates and to
    view the agenda.
    #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
      (my-app-def
        "c" 'org-capture
        "a" 'org-agenda)
    #+END_SRC

** Agenda

*** Agenda files                                                        :GTD:

    We only want to show agenda items from the GTD files where actual items lie, so there's no some day / maybe list included.
    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (setq org-agenda-files '("~/gtd/inbox.org"
                               "~/gtd/main.org"
                               "~/gtd/tickler.org"))
    #+end_src



*** Custom commands

    Let's create some custom commands to use with the agenda view:
    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (setq org-agenda-custom-commands
            '(("w" "Work" tags-todo "work")
              ("b" "Blog" tags-todo "blog")
              ("e" "Emacs" tags-todo "emacs")
              ("o" "Org" tags-todo "org")
              ("g" "GTD" tags-todo "GTD")))
    #+end_src

*** Weekly view

    For the weekly view, instead of seeing the current week (Monday through Sunday), I prefer seeing the next ~n~ and the previous ~m~ days.
    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (setq org-agenda-start-on-weekday nil
            org-agenda-span 10
            org-agenda-start-day "-3d")
    #+end_src

*** Scheduling

    Org has an option to not show repeated scheduling info after
    deadlines, which essentially acts as a 'repeat until' date.

    #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
      (setq org-agenda-skip-scheduled-if-deadline-is-shown 'repeated-after-deadline)
    #+END_SRC


** Org-ref

   I use [[https://github.com/jkitchin/org-ref][org-ref]] for managing bibliographies and citations.

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     (use-package org-ref
       :after org
       :init (setq reftex-default-bibliography'("~/gtd/bibliography/references.bib")
                   org-ref-bibliography-notes "~/gtd/bibliography/notes.org"
                   org-ref-default-bibliography'("~/gtd/bibliography/references.bib")
                   org-ref-pdf-directory "~/gtd/bibliography/bibtex-pdfs/"
                   bibtex-completion-bibliography "~/gtd/bibliography/references.bib"
                   bibtex-completion-library-path "~/gtd/bibliography/bibtex-pdfs"
                   bibtex-completion-notes-path "~/gtd/bibliography/helm-bibtext-notes"))
   #+end_src

** Babel

   In addition to the basic org-babel setup, we can add some more
   languages and a couple extra packages to make it even smoother to
   work with.

   First off, let's add some more languages.
   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (org-babel-do-load-languages
      'org-babel-load-languages
      '((emacs-lisp . t)
        (shell . t)))
   #+END_SRC

   One such package is [[https://github.com/zweifisch/ob-http][ob-http]], which allows you to make HTTP requests from org source blocks:
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     (use-package ob-http
       :init (add-to-list 'org-babel-load-languages '(http . t)))
   #+end_src


   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (use-package ob-rust
       :init (add-to-list 'org-babel-load-languages '(rust . t)))
   #+END_SRC


   Because I trust myself (somewhat foolishly perhaps) to only execute org code
   blocks that I know to be safe, I don't want to be prompted when executing a code block:
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     (setq org-confirm-babel-evaluate nil)
   #+end_src

** Other settings

   I like seeing symbols in my buffer, rather than LaTeX commands.
   This makes '\alpha + \pi' look like 'α + π' and also displays sub- and
   superscripts properly.

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     (setq org-pretty-entities t)
   #+end_src

   I also want my footnotes to be automatically sorted and renumbered whenever I insert a new one.
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     (setq org-footnote-auto-adjust t)
   #+end_src


   Furthermore, I /always/ want to org to log into drawers, so let's set that too:
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     (setq org-log-into-drawer t)
   #+end_src

   While I like electric-pair-mode, the fact that ~<~ inserts a
   closing ~>~ is an issue for templates. This code is based on [[https://www.topbug.net/blog/2016/09/29/emacs-disable-certain-pairs-for-electric-pair-mode/][this
   blog post]].

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no
     (defun my-org-mode-hook ()
       (setq-local electric-pair-inhibit-predicate
		   `(lambda (c)
		      (if (char-equal c ?<) t (,electric-pair-inhibit-predicate c)))))
     (add-hook 'org-mode-hook 'my-org-mode-hook)
   #+end_src

** Additional keybindings                                        :keybinding:

   There some org functionality that's not bound to anything by
   default, so let's see what we can do about that.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (general-def
       :keymaps 'org-mode-map
       "C-c _" 'org-toggle-timestamp-type
       "C-a" 'my-move-beginning-of-line)

     (my-link-def
       "s" 'org-store-link)
   #+END_SRC



** Focus next heading

   When working through large org files, I find it useful to focus on
   only a single subtree at a time. Often, I want to close all other
   subtrees and only see this one. We can write a function for that.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (defvar my-org-heading-navigation-show-headings-only nil
       "t if movement should show just subheadings and not content.")

     (defun my-org-open-heading-base (arg motion)
       (when arg
         (setq
          my-org-heading-navigation-show-headings-only
          (not my-org-heading-navigation-show-headings-only)))
       (let ((show-contents
              (if my-org-heading-navigation-show-headings-only
                  'outline-show-children
                'outline-show-subtree)))
         (outline-hide-sublevels (org-outline-level))
         (funcall motion 1)
         (funcall show-contents)))

     (defun my-org-open-next-heading (arg)
       "Close the current heading and open the next one.

     If ARG is non-nil, only show subheadings of the next heading
     instead of the entire subtree."
       (interactive "P")
       (my-org-open-heading-base arg 'org-forward-heading-same-level))

     (defun my-org-open-previous-heading (arg)
       "Close the current heading and open the previous one.

     If ARG is non-nil, only show subheadings of the previous heading
     instead of the entire subtree."
       (interactive "P")
       (my-org-open-heading-base arg 'org-backward-heading-same-level))

     (general-def
       org-mode-map
       "<up>" 'my-org-open-previous-heading
       "<down>" 'my-org-open-next-heading)

     (general-def

** templates (org-tempo)
   :LOGBOOK:
   - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2020-08-13 Thu 09:29]
   - State "TODO"       from "TODO"       [2020-08-13 Thu 09:29]
   - State "TODO"       from              [2020-08-12 Wed 14:52]
   :END:

   To reclaim the functionality of expanding ~<s~, ~<q~ and others
   into org blocks, we need to add ~org-tempo~ to the list of
   org-modules. More info is found in the Reddit thread [[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/ad68zk/get_easytemplates_back_in_orgmode_92/][Get
   easy-templates back in org-mode 9.2]].

   Because org-tempo might not be available before 9.2, let's only add
   it if it /is/ available.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (add-to-list 'org-modules 'org-tempo)
   #+END_SRC

** Configuration:
   :LOGBOOK:
   - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2020-08-20 Thu 21:11]
   - State "TODO"       from              [2020-08-18 Tue 19:16]
   :END:

   The default value of ~org-src-window-setup~ reshuffles the whole
   frame when you edit a source block. I find this to be both annoying
   and disturbing, so let's instead have org mode simply create a new
   window for it.

   Additionally, we can also have ~C-a~, ~C-e~, and ~C-k~ adapt to
   whether they're being invoked in a headline or not.
   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (setq org-src-window-setup 'split-window-right
	   org-special-ctrl-a/e t
	   org-special-ctrl-k t)
   #+END_SRC


** Overrides

   Based on [[https://stackoverflow.com/a/54251825][this Stack Overflow answer]], we can make org-capture not
   delete other windows by redefining some functionality before
   calling it:
   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (defun my-org-capture-place-template (oldfun args)
       (cl-letf (((symbol-function 'delete-other-windows) 'ignore))
         (apply oldfun args)))

   To be able to store links to notmuch emails, we can require
   org-notmuch. However, this requires that we add the contrib

   be done like this on NixOS:

   To improve the mail fetching and polling operation, let's

  find.

* Mode line

  We can configure the mode line to only show what we want. I find
  that the default displ/ays far more information than I know what to
  do with, so let's trim it down a bit and show only what's necessary.

      Make this work as expected with EXWM.

      Currently, when previewing buffers, if they are X-windows, then they
      are removed from their original position and not restored. This is
      bothersome. There is an [[https://github.com/muffinmad/emacs-mini-frame/pull/29][open PR]] that at least fixes something related
      to this, but I'm not sure how it affects everything as a whole.

      Further: it might be nice if X windows aren't moved at all?
